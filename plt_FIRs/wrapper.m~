% this is the wrapper code for the pt_FIRs functions. This code applies the
% functionality across participants and TRs, to define the beta images
% according to their condition, create new mask images by ROI x strength of
% response to the task stimulus, and to plot the fitted FIR function for
% each participant, and averaged across participants
